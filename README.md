# TAR-Cinema-Ticketing-System
/TARC Assignment for C++ Programming/
TAR StarMax shows a popular movie every Friday night. The cinema is open to the public, but any students who show their student registration card can get a cheaper rate. The management of TAR StarMax has hired you to develop a simple Ticketing Program that will issue tickets for the upcoming movie of the week. It also requires a report on the ticket sales for the movie.
